Type: potential_issue

Prompt for AI Agent:
In frontend/flutter_analyze_output_latest.txt (lines 1-2): this is a transient Flutter analysis output that should not be tracked; remove it from version control with git rm --cached frontend/flutter_analyze_output_latest.txt, add an ignore pattern to .gitignore such as /flutter_analyze_output.txt and flutter_analyze_output.txt (or the repo's preferred pattern), commit the .gitignore change, and update CI to produce the analysis file as an artifact during the build rather than committing it to the repo.

Prompt for AI Agent:
In frontend/flutter_analyze_latest.txt (lines 1-155): this file is an analysis report artifact that should be removed from version control and CI should run flutter analyze instead; delete this .txt from the commit and add a CI step running flutter analyze (fail on errors/warnings). Also fix the three blocking code issues noted: in lib/src/features/admin/admin_management_dashboard/admin_management_dashboard.dart at ~lines 193 and 351 null-check the DateTime values before calling toIso8601String() (guard with if/null-aware access or provide a fallback), in lib/src/features/advisor/advisor_approval_dashboard/advisor_approval_dashboard.dart at ~lines 231 and 260 either import/define the missing LeaveRequestsTab and AttendanceTab widgets or replace the calls with the correct widget names, and in lib/src/features/shared_features/student_profile_screen/student_profile_screen.dart at ~line 79 ensure the argument is non-null (null-check, provide an empty List if null, or use .whereType()/cast to produce List). Remove the .txt artifact and add the analyzer to CI as a separate commit.

Prompt for AI Agent:
In frontend/android/gradle.properties around lines 27-28, remove the hardcoded platform-specific trustStore path and plaintext keystore password; instead reference environment variables or Gradle/system properties passed at build time (e.g. use a property like systemProp.javax.net.ssl.trustStore=${env.TRUST_STORE_PATH} and systemProp.javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=${env.TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD}) or delete these entries to rely on the JVM default truststore, and document or provide a gitignored local .properties file for developer-specific settings so secrets are not committed.

Prompt for AI Agent:
In frontend/ios/Runner/Base.lproj/LaunchScreen.storyboard around lines 19 to 26, the imageView only has centerX/centerY constraints and no explicit size, which can yield zero size if the LaunchImage asset is missing; add explicit width and height constraints for the imageView (or enable/infer intrinsic content size by ensuring the image asset exists and the imageView's contentMode and translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints settings allow intrinsic sizing) so the launcher image always has a defined size.

Prompt for AI Agent:
frontend/android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml around line 11: the comment "Production domain config for specific IP addresses" is misleading because domain-config sets cleartextTrafficPermitted="true", which permits unencrypted HTTP and is appropriate for development/staging, not production; update the comment to accurately reflect that this entry allows cleartext traffic for development or staging (e.g., "Development/staging domain config for specific IP addresses — allows cleartext traffic") and ensure any future edits do not retain the "Production" label that could lead to insecure production deployments.

Prompt for AI Agent:
In frontend/ios/Runner/Base.lproj/Main.storyboard around line 2, the document tag uses an outdated toolsVersion/systemVersion from the Xcode 7 / iOS 9 era; update it by regenerating the storyboard with a current Xcode (open the storyboard in the latest Xcode and save) or manually set the document attributes to match your installed Xcode’s toolsVersion and systemVersion (create a new storyboard in Xcode to inspect the correct values) so the storyboard is compatible with modern iOS SDKs and avoids build/runtime compatibility issues.

Prompt for AI Agent:
In frontend/linux/runner/main.cc around lines 3 to 6, add a NULL check after my_application_new() so the program gracefully handles allocation failure: if my_application_new() returns NULL, emit a clear error message (e.g., with g_printerr or g_warning) and return a non-zero exit code instead of passing NULL to g_application_run(); keep the g_autoptr for cleanup so no manual free is required when the check passes.
